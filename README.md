# QuestbookOS
QuestbookOS is a web-based linux distro. It functions like Windows 8, but has some key components like ChromiumOS / Google ChromeOS.
The whole point of this is project to prove that anyone can make a desktop environment using HTML & Javascript and a little bit of python.

All applications will have their own .HTML files in different folders, thanks to the CSS and Javascript libraries that I am using to buidl this DE and QuesbookOS too!

### How will this function?
* QuestbookOS will be built on top of the Linux Kernel
* The desktop environment is powered by Google's V8 Javascript engine
* User interface was created with HTML, CSS and Javascript
